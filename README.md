Matplotlib - Moudle 5 Challengue
Data Loading and Merging:

The code imports the pandas library and loads two datasets: mouse_metadata and study_results.
It then merges these datasets based on the common column "Mouse ID", creating a new DataFrame called merge_data. This step is crucial for combining information about each mouse with their corresponding study results.
Number of Unique Mice IDs:

The code calculates the number of unique mice IDs present in the merged dataset using the nunique() function on the "Mouse ID" column.
This step provides insight into the total number of unique mice involved in the study.
Identification of Duplicate Time Points:

The code checks for duplicate rows based on both "Mouse ID" and "Timepoint" columns in the merged dataset.
If there are duplicates, it identifies the duplicate mouse ID and displays the associated data.
This is important for quality control purposes, as duplicate entries might indicate errors or inconsistencies in the data collection process.
Creation of Cleaned DataFrame:

The code creates a new DataFrame called cleaned_data by filtering out rows associated with the identified duplicate mouse ID.
Removing duplicates ensures the integrity of the dataset and prevents potential biases or inaccuracies in subsequent analyses.
Updated Number of Unique Mice IDs:

Finally, the code recalculates the number of unique mice IDs in the cleaned dataset.
This step confirms that the duplicate entries have been successfully removed from the dataset.
Overall, this analysis workflow demonstrates essential data preparation steps, including data loading, merging, quality checking, and cleaning. Ensuring data integrity and consistency is crucial for conducting reliable analyses and drawing accurate conclusions from the dataset.
